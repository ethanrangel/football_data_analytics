# football_data_analytics

## Why did I do this project?

I decided to start this project because of my current internship as a Cloud Engineer. Although my role was initially supposed to focus on cloud technologies, I have recently been working more with the Data Engineering team. Together, we have been creating an ETL pipeline to extract data from DynamoDB, transform the data using Spark DataFrames to create tables based on our ERD, and finally load these tables into a relational database. This process reduces query time and increases search productivity. It was a great experience to learn both Cloud Formation and Python scripting.

Since I learned so much about data frames and using Python libraries to work with data, I decided to do a project combining data with my passion for football (soccer). I have been playing football since I was 5 years old and still play competitively. In my free time, especially on weekends, I watch the Premier League and sometimes wake up as early as 7 AM if there's a good match. When I saw ideas on web scraping football matches and using machine learning to predict outcomes, it was a no-brainer for me to dive in. Through this process, I have improved my Python skills, learned web scraping, and gained experience with machine learning.

## Organization of Repo:

1. **Web Scraping:** The first part of this repo contains the web scraping script, where I scraped a website containing football stats of teams in the Premier League. I worked with data from the last four years, resulting in a CSV file with 3800 rows and 27 columns.

2. **Machine Learning:** In the second part, I used machine learning libraries to train an AI model to predict football matches based on the CSV file. After experimenting with various methods, I managed to achieve a prediction accuracy of over 70%.
